        <b>Information needed for car insurance</b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Before you purchase a car or start driving, it's important to ask: what
        do you need for car insurance?
      </p>
      <p>
        To start a new car insurance policy, you'll need to provide the
        following:
        <ul>
          <li>Personal information</li>
          <li>Information about your driving history</li>
          <li>Vehicle information</li>
          <li>Banking information</li>
          <li>Supplemental information to qualify for discounts</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b> Personal Information </b> <br />
            <span>
              You’ll need to provide the car insurance company with personal
              information like your full name, date of birth, and address.
              <br />
              You’ll also need to provide your social security number, as most
              companies will conduct a credit score check to determine your car
              insurance rates. <br />
              Providing your driver’s license number and state helps verify you
              are legally able to drive, and it allows insurance companies to
              review your driving history.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b> Information About Your Driving History </b> <br />
            <span>
              You’ll answer questions about your driving history. The auto
              insurance company will need to know about recent tickets or
              citations, accidents, and any information about license
              suspension.
              <br />
              Insurance companies mostly ask for a history of three to five
              years, but this time frame will vary by state and provider. <br />
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b> Vehicle Information </b> <br />
            <span>
              You will then need to provide information about your car,
              including the year, make, and model to the insurer. You’ll also be
              asked for the vehicle identification number (VIN) "think to change
              to plate number"{" "}
              <b>Check this steps to fit the data-flow on this site.</b>
              <br />
              In addition to this information about your vehicle, you may also
              be asked to provide:
              <ul>
                <li>Vehicle mileage</li>
                <li>Address where the car is garaged</li>
                <li>Name of the registered owner</li>
                <li>Date of purchase</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              To qualify for discounts, you can gather information about safety
              and security features installed on the car like anti-theft
              devices, airbags, and more. <br /> To go on filling here go:
