          This project is made without actual objective in mind from the get-go!
        </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Started as a CRUD project with a class of cars containing basic
        informations such as manufacturer and plate numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        As time passed still having no idea as to what this project should do i
        just randomly <br /> put information around and played with it hoping
        for a idea to pop out
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end nothing really came to mind and randomly searched car related
        stuff wich made this project related to insurances
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end i don't have any actual talent in design so have no idea how
        this will look UI wise
      </p>
    </div>
